# Rock Paper Scissors Game
----

# Description
Welcome to my project! I had the joy of creating a Rock Paper Scissors game, where users are able to play against the server. I utilized my skills in Node.js, HTML, and CSS to create the functionality and look to this project. I hope you enjoy! 


**How to:**

Users will be allowed three choices: Rock, Paper, Scissors. Once you select your choice, the server will randomize a selection and with this you will either win, lose, or come into a tie!
