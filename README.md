# Rock Paper Scissors Game
----

# Description
Welcome to my project! I had the joy of creating a Rock Paper Scissors game, where users are able to play against the server. I utilized my skills in Node.js, HTML, and CSS to create the functionality and look to this project. I hope you enjoy! 


**How to:**
TO play this game, you select one of three options. After you select an option, the computer will randomly generate a choice which will then 'battle' your choice and update the scoreboard accordingly.
